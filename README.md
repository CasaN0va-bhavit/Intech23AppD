Hello user,
This is Bhavit Grover's chat application for the Intech'23 App Development Competition.

Steps to run :-

1) To run this file, you need to have yarn installed on your computer. (You can install yarn by ```npm install -global yarn```)
2) Install expo by typing ```npm install -global expo``` and then run these commands:
```
expo install firebase
expo install expo-constants dotenv
expo install react-native-gesture-handler
expo install react-native-screens
expo install react-native-safe-area-context
expo install react-native-masked-view
yarn add react-native-gifted-chat
yarn add @react-navigation/native-stack @react-navigation/native
```
3) Once installed, you can run this command in the terminal:-
    ```npx expo start``` or ```expo start```.
4) If you want to run this on a physical device, you can install "Expo Go" app from Play Store or App Store on your machine and then scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on Android or Scanner in iOS. Wait a few seconds  and then the app will open. But if you want to run this on an emulator, after the server is started and the emulator too, just type ```a``` on your PC/Laptop's keyboard and then it should install Expo Go on the emulator and the application should run fine.

How to use the App:-
1) You can Log In if you already have an account or Sign Up.
2) After logging in, you will automatically be directed to the home page.
3) When you are at the home page, click on the Chat ICON on the bottom-left side of the screen.
4) Happy Chatting!
